      <description>No, I am not to blame. I see no guilt, I feel none.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m told that a true Russian should repent for all the crimes committed by Russia against Ukraine.

      <description>Yesterday I read the news about a boy from Belgrade who killed 9 people in his school with his father&amp;rsquo;s gun. It was a terrible event. I feel like a monster for losing my ability to empathize with people. I lost my empathy after Russia crimes in Ukraine. In Russia we get used to negative news, so nobody would even notice. But this terrible event rises another questions in my mind.</description>
