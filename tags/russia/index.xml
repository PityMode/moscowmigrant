      <description>No, I am not to blame. I see no guilt, I feel none.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m told that a true Russian should repent for all the crimes committed by Russia against Ukraine. But I don&amp;rsquo;t feel any guilt, and here are my arguments.&#xA;My entire being is against war, murder, and treachery. To avoid becoming a killer, I had to leave and rebuild my life from scratch. Starting over when you already have something to leave behind is difficult.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m from Moscow, living in Montenegro, moved here with my small family at the beginning of 2022. I don&amp;rsquo;t complain about life, living modestly, but have a job for now.&#xA;I am constantly haunted by thoughts of why things turned out this way. Did we have a choice? Can we change something, and how? This will be the focus of my blog.&#xA;It will be available in four languages - Russian, English, Ukrainian, and Serbian.</description>
