      <description>No, I am not to blame. I see no guilt, I feel none.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m told that a true Russian should repent for all the crimes committed by Russia against Ukraine. But I don&amp;rsquo;t feel any guilt, and here are my arguments.&#xA;My entire being is against war, murder, and treachery. To avoid becoming a killer, I had to leave and rebuild my life from scratch. Starting over when you already have something to leave behind is difficult.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I read the news about a boy from Belgrade who killed 9 people in his school with his father&amp;rsquo;s gun. It was a terrible event. I feel like a monster for losing my ability to empathize with people. I lost my empathy after Russia crimes in Ukraine. In Russia we get used to negative news, so nobody would even notice. But this terrible event rises another questions in my mind.</description>

      <description>I am from Moscow, live in Serbia, and moved here in 2022 with my small family. I can&amp;rsquo;t complain about life; we live modestly, but I have work for now.&#xA;I am constantly haunted by thoughts of why things turned out this way. Did we have a choice? Can we change something, and how? This will be the focus of my blog.&#xA;It will be available in four languages - Russian, English, Ukrainian, and Serbian.</description>
