      <description>Yesterday I read the news about a boy from Belgrade who killed 9 people in his school with his father&amp;rsquo;s gun. It was a terrible event. I feel like a monster for losing my ability to empathize with people. In Russia, this would have been a common occurrence.
Serbia is very similar to Russia, and I am afraid that the same scenario could happen here.
The first harmful action was the introduction of strict gun control laws.</description>
